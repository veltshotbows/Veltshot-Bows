Subject: Join the Adventure: Invest in Veltshot Bows and Turn Invasive Trees into Gold
Hey Trevor,
Hope this finds you well across the pond! 
Nick raved about your eye for smart, passion-driven ventures.
Thought you'd dig Veltshot Bows, my Kloof-based startup, crafting traditional longbows and recurves from SA's pesky invasives like black wattle, 
to premium exotics for serious archers.
It's sustainable, hands-on, and taps a growing market (archery gear's booming 6% yearly here, with locals craving affordable, eco-traditional kit).
Why's this a no-brainer for you? You're getting ground-floor access to a lean, profitable machine: 
Entry selfbows at R1,000 (beating the R1,500+ average), premiums at R2,500—margins 60%+ once rolling. 
Projections show R8k/month breakeven by month 3, scaling to R30k+ by year 1 with 10-15 sales (realistic via KZN clubs and online buzz). 
Your backing? A tidy R12,000 investment covering:

Tools (second-hand gems): Belt sander (R1,500), bandsaw (R2,500), planer (R1,000)—total R5,000. Unlocks laminated builds fast.
Materials: Epoxy resins (R1,200) + hardwood stockpile (R1,300)—total R2,500. Starts prototypes rolling.
Online/Ads: Wix .co.za domain/hosting setup (R150/year) + Grok sub for biz smarts (R300/month) + 4 weeks FB/Google ads (R3,000-4,000, targeting SA hunters/archers at R5-20/click).

In return: 25% equity stake for 18 months—your slice of profits (e.g., R2k/month by mid-year) + bragging rights on exporting to the UK scene. 
Plus, I'll craft and ship you a custom wattle selfbow (R1,000 value) as a thank-you—perfect for your collection or gifting.
The safety net? If we're not hitting stride in 12 months (unlikely with the eco-hook), I'll sell the tools/materials and wire you the full R12k back—no sweat. 
It's low-risk impact investing: Back a local lad sustaining via craftsmanship, clearing invasives, and making archery accessible. 
Win for you, SA, and the wild.
